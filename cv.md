## About Me
I am 33 years old. I have worked as a civil engineer for several years. At some point, I realized that I wanted to change my profession.
Since I have always been interested in programming, I decided to learn how to do it professionally. Now my goal is to become a highly skilled full-stack developer.

## Skills

* **JavaScript**
* **Vue/vuex**
* **Gulp, Webpack**

## Code Example
```javascript
function myLanguages(obj) {
   return Object.entries(obj).filter(([, value]) => value >= 60)
      .sort(([, a], [, b]) => b - a).map(([lang]) => lang)
}
```
